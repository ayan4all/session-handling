# session-handling
Basic session handling code in PHP

This is a simple application to allow user to login using a dummy user/pass and redirects them to home page.
If someone directly goes to the home page without login then it should say access denied and ask user to go back to Login.

To test this application in your localhost go to the http://localhost/session-handling/login.php and Login using credentials mentioned within the code and it will redirect you to http://localhost/session-handling/home.php

Note: There is a pre-requisite that any web server like apache should be running in localhost and should be confugured to parse php.
